# The r package titanic, contains paid passenger information only, and its data source is Kaggle.  

```{r}
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/titanic.complete")
# install.packages("titanic")
library(titanic)

titanic_kaggle=bind_rows(titanic_test %>% mutate(data_set = "test"),
                       titanic_train %>% mutate(data_set = "train"))

titanic_compare = 
  full_join(titanic_both %>% mutate(in_kaggle = "in_kaggle") %>% rename(name = Name),
            titanic_complete %>% mutate(in_wikipedia = "in_wikipedia")) %>% 
  select(in_kaggle, in_wikipedia, name, everything())

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
